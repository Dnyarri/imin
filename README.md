# Barycentric and bilinear image interpolation in pure Python

Currently this repository contains code for [barycentric image interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system) and [bilinear image interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation), and somewhat optimized code for image rescaling using methods above.

More code is expected as soon as it will be generalized and/or optimized enough.
